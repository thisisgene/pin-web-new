    <p><em>pin – Verein für Partizipation, Integration &amp; Nachhaltigkeit</em></p>

<p>(association for participation, integration and networking) is a young non-profit organization, which stands up for structural and political change in society as a whole. In this process sustainable integration measures and the support for structurally disadvantaged groups as well as individuals, especially persons with experiences of displacement and escape, have priority. The members of pin are committed to being a part of the local integration network and their aim is to encourage social, economic and cultural integration by applying sustainable strategies – such as  promoting access to the labor market and education as well as awareness-raising actions.</p>

<p>By the use of the following measures those goals are supposed to be achieved:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Promotion of dialogue on theoretical, practical and structural levels through rhetoric trainings, panel discussion and informational events</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thematization and visualizing structural lacks as well as disadvantages and discrimination, especially in the educational sector and the labor market</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Furtherance of integration of local actors by networking and the organization of publicly accessible events for members</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Preparation and provision of informative, pedagogical and scientific material</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Trainings, workshops and counseling on the topics escape, migration and integration as well as awareness-raising and sensitization of discrimination and inequality</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Promotion of sustainability policies and aspects of integration measures</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Participation</strong></p>

<p>We understand participation to mean the active co-determination and participation in decision-making processes. This includes the contribution of ideas as well as the participation in projects, events and dialogue. One of our objectives is to encourage the cooperation with individuals, associations, organization and institutions. Thereby we focus on the attempt to continually speak to each other instead of for others.</p>

<p><strong>Integration</strong></p>

<p>For pin integration, especially sustainable integration stands for a dynamic, long-lasting and very differentiated process of growing together. This very process must be ensured by promoting the following points:
multidimensional communication
convergence and acceptance of shared responsibilities, which represent improvements for everyone
awareness for the “integration instead of assimilation” principle
solidarity and understanding for the topic escape and migration as well as according and relevant coherences
“participate and let participate”
integration in the educational sector and labor market
equal opportunities and support through information and counseling</p>

<p><strong>Sustainability</strong></p>

<p>We take sustainability to mean the combination of foresight and continuity. With our projects we aim at long-lasting effects and achieving effective problem-solving approaches through forward-looking thinking and action. We are convinced that social and structural changes cannot be achieved overnight, but through continuous work.</p>
